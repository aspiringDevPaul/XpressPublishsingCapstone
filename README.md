# X-Press Publishing

## Project Overview

In this capstone project, you will build all of the routing and database logic for an internal tool for a comic book publishing company called X-Press Publishing.

The X-Press Publishing internal tool should allow users to:
- Create, view, and update artists
- Create, view, update, and delete comic book series
- Create, view, update, and delete issues of a specific comic book series

You can view all of this functionality in action in the video below:
